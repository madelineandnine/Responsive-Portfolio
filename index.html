        <p>Well, I was not born in Paris, and there were no houses with vines, but I am Madeline, but please call me Maddie. </p>

        <p> I work in fundraising and marketing for a local museum. My passion has always been American history, but muddling my way through graphic design and computers has always been an easy second. I'm excited to find ways to bridge the gap between the humanities and the work the Museum is doing and the endless digital resources available.</p>

        <p>I grew up in North Carolina, but was born in Iowa. I moved to Richmond three years ago after a six year stint in South Carolina - an area with the distinct honor of being the furthest north you could go while still being a sub-tropical climate.</p>
            
        <p>I have a wonderful dog named Hank and an even better fiance named Mike.</p>
